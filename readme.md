# Process Scheduler lab
## For CSC-213 Operating Systems at Grinnell College
### By Nate Williams and Isa Nation

Testing, makefile, "worm", and some scaffolding code is provided by Prof. Hajiamini. Assignment is to implement a scheduler in C according to a set of detailed specifications. The scheduler runs a process until it blocks, and then it performs a round-robin search to the next available process to run.

To test the scheduler, simply compile and run any of the test programs in the test directory, or compile and run the worm game which uses the scheduler.
